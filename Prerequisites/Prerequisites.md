### <a name="check-eclipse-maven"></a>Check if Eclipse/Maven is installed and Java set-up is done correctly
Check if eclipse/Maven is installed and Java set-up is done correctly. 
Building successfully a Maven-based Java project in your Eclipse is a prerequisite.
Now you are ready to test if can build and run a Java Web application project with Maven in your Eclipse IDE. For this test we prepared a Maven-based HelloWorld Java project as follows.

1. Download the archive file [helloworld.zip](https://sap.github.io/cloud-s4ext/week-1/unit-5/imports/java/helloworld.zip?raw=true).
1. Extract the *helloworld.zip* archive to a directory of your choice
1. From the Eclipse menu, choose **File->Import…** to open the Import wizard  
	![](images/20.png)
1. Choose **Maven->Existing Maven Projects** and click **Next**  
	![](images/21.png)
1. In the Import Maven Projects dialog:
	- Click **Browse** and select the helloworld directory where you have extracted the *helloworld.zip*
	- The *helloworld/pom.xml* will be listed in the Projects section
	- Select the checkbox of this *pom.xml*
	- Choose **Finish** to start importing the Maven project into your Eclipse workspace
	![](images/22.png)  
	
	> **Info**: POM is an acronym for Project Object Model. It is an XML representation of a Maven project held in a file named pom.xml. For more information see the Maven documentation

1. In the Project Explorer view of the Java EE Perspective you should find now the imported *helloworld*  
	![](images/23.png)
1. Right-click on the *helloworld* project node to open the Context Menu. Choose **Run As->Maven install** to start the Maven build for the *helloworld* project  
	![](images/24.png)
1. The Eclipse IDE will open a Console Tab that displays the build progress. You should see **BUILD SUCCESS**. If your build was not successful, please check the troubleshooting guide for Maven  
	![](images/25.png)
1. In Project Explorer view expand the project node **helloworld->target** to find the built *helloworld.war* file.

	> Note: To see it you might have to refresh the project by right-clicking on the project-node and press Refresh  
	
	![](images/26.png)
	
1.  Maven has build successfully the *helloworld* Java web application and created a *helloworld.war* file (see console output for the location).


## Summary
You have successfully completed the prerequisites installation.
